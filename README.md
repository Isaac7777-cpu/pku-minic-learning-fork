# pku-minic-learning-fork

I am trying to learn the compiler as described here: [pku-minic](https://github.com/pku-minic). Also, I am trying to be greedy in a sense that I want to implement it in both C++ and Rust because I just want to see how the two languages differ. It is clear that the `cpp/` directory would, naturally, contain the code for C++ implementation while the `rust/` directory would contain the code for Rust implementation.
